# SplashPatch
So you've updated Photoshop 2020 and are ready to open it and ***oh my god why is it so bright my eyes ow they burn ouch owwie ow why is it so white?*** and then the splash screen closes to the same dark Photoshop look.

***Please note: SplashPatch is currently in pre-release, both the Engine and Wizard may have many bugs, It is currently stable enough to use however mileage may vary.***
## Save it
SplashPatch can automatically save splash images to PNG, making it much easier to keep, edit and share the currently applied splash image. 
## Change it back
SplashPatch gives you the ability to auto-magically change the splash image in pretty much all Adobe Creative Cloud products between 2017 and present with just a PNG.
## Customize
SplashPatch can change the splash images to whatever image you want, be it your dog or a funny inside joke, as long as it is the correct dimensions.
## Disclaimer
***SplashPatch does not nor will it ever modify programs to allow "Hacked" or "Cracked" versions for free, it solely modifies legitimately acquired activated and trial versions.*** SplashPatch does not support beta releases.

SplashPatch will must at least replace a PNG, modify existing resource archives, to even modifying important `.dll` and `.exe` files required for the programs to launch. Although SplashPatch makes an effort to back up files prior to modification, if failed it may require the program to be reinstalled, ***please remember to backup your copy, this is especially important with slow internet as downloads can take several hours.***
